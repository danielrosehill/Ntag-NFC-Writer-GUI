# NFC Writer GUI For NTAG213/215/216 (OpenSUSE Tumbleweed Linux)

 ![alt text](screenshots/v3/1.png)

This Python GUI was fully generated using Claude Sonnet 3.5. 

It is designed for writing URLs to NTAG213/215/216 type NFC tags (Mifare Ultralight C compatible tags) using the ACR. 1252 USB NFC reader/writer.

These tags are widely available on platforms like Aliexpress, are cheap and affordable and suitable for use (my use-case) for inventory management systems.

I use and recommend the excellent Homebox.

I have been using it on Open SUSE Tumbleweed (KDE Plasma) .
