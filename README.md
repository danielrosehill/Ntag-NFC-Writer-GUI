# NFC Writer GUI For NTAG213/215/216 (OpenSUSE Tumbleweed Linux)

![alt text](screenshots/v1/1.png)

This Python GUI was fully generated using Claude Sonnet 3.5. 

It is designed for writing URLs to NTAG213/215/216 type NFC tags (Mifare Ultralight C compatible tags) using the ACR. 1252 USB NFC reader/writer.

These tags are widely available on platforms like Aliexpress, are cheap and affordable and suitable for use (my use-case) for inventory management systems.

I use and recommend the excellent Homebox.

I have been using it on Open SUSE Tumbleweed (KDE Plasma) .

### V1

After learning that attempting to get compatibility for every type of NFC tag was way more complicated than it looked, I decided to be more modest and focus on the couple of tags I was working with at the NDEF level.

The GUI is intended for those quickly writing lots of these tags for the purpose of an inventory system. It features a convenient tally light to let the user know when the card is ready to be written, and then a safe to remove indicator in the tag has been written and locked.
